<p>All cameras are wired to the center console, near the airbag module of the car, where I will mount a nVidia Jetson Orin NX.</p>

<p>TODO: add surround camera to front as well as tight/zoom IR-sensitive cameras for active night vision. Also add IR flood light up front.</p>

<h2 id="surround-cameras">Surround Cameras</h2>

<p>Two fisheye cameras are included on the sides of the car, one in each wing mirror, to provide complete coverage of each side of the car. These cameras were mounted using a 3D-printed bracket that piggy backs off of some existing screws within the factory mirror mount and position the camera such that its optic rests flush with the factory mirror trim. In order to get the lens through the mirror trim, I used a soldering iron to cut through the plastic and then sanded the edges to get them as smoothly as possible. The passenger-side mirror came out a little rough but the drivers side looks pretty swell.</p>
