<p>I managed to rear end someone in this car, definitely my fault, but I was not willing to let it die that soon because I had barely done any work on it. The accident luckily wasn’t very bad, the other car suffered next to no damage and mine took most of the hit. I wasn’t going awfully fast when I hit the other car so my front end did not crumple much and the car was therefore perfectly fine, mechanically. Here are pictures of the repair process :)</p>
