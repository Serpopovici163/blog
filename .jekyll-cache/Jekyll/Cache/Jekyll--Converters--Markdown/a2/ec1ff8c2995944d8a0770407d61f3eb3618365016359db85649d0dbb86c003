<p>I managed to rear end someone in this car, definitely my fault, but I was not willing to let it die that soon because I had barely done any work on it. The accident luckily wasnâ€™t very bad, the other car suffered next to no damage and mine took most of the hit. I wasnâ€™t going awfully fast when I hit the other car so my front end did not crumple much and the car was therefore perfectly fine, mechanically speaking that is. Here are pictures of the repair process :)</p>

<p>Here are some pictures immediately following the accident showing the extent of the damage. I bent a variety of things up front but the frame rails of the car remained straight. These pictures show the bent front crash bar, bent rad support, bent fender, and bent hood.</p>

<p>This happened in the fall when I didnâ€™t have much capital to throw around so I solely replaced the front crash bar and rad support which allowed the hood to close again. Due to the way the car was bent, the hood would not close again once I finally got it open.</p>
