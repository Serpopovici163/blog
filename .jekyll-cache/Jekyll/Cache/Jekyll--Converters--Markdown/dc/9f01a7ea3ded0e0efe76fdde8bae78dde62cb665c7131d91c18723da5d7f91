<p>Steering wheel buttons were added to BRZs in 2017 and mine is a 2013 so I purchased a salvage steering wheel in order to integrate its buttons into my systems. Should anybody else contemplate to do the same, be aware that even though steering wheels are cheap the airbag most certainly is not: a brand new OEM airbag for my car is $CAD 1100 from the dealer while a used one is ~$CAD 700 (I got one of these and it is most likely counterfeit so it may be more of a grenade than it is an airbag - choose wisely).</p>

<p>The steering wheel uses an Arduino Nano to convert button presses into CAN messages that are sent along my CAN network. In order to interface the Arduino with the steering wheel, I took apart the button clusters on each side of the 
<img src="/assets/img/brz/steering_wheel_button_connector.jpg" alt="Steering wheel button connector" style="float: right; width:50%; height:80%; margin-left: 10px;" />
steering wheel and followed traces to figure out the function of each wire. My findings are listed below for anybody else intending to reverse engineer the steering wheel buttons on a BRZ (wires are listed from left to right, top to bottom, looking at the connector from behind as depicted to the right):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light green –&gt; Volume and arrow keys of left side cluster</li>
  <li>Red –&gt; Common of left side cluster</li>
  <li>Green –&gt; Arrow keys of right side cluster</li>
  <li>Purple –&gt; Enter and back key of right side cluster</li>
  <li>Yellow –&gt; Common of right side cluster</li>
  <li>Black –&gt; Call buttons, source button, left enter button, and voice button</li>
  <li>Blue –&gt; Steering wheel ground</li>
  <li>Brown –&gt; Cruise control pin 1</li>
  <li>Grey –&gt; Cruise control pin 2</li>
  <li>Black + White –&gt; LED ground</li>
  <li>White –&gt; LED VCC (5V works but LEDs are dim. Not sure I’m willing to go higher so I’ll suck it up)</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘voice’ button on the right side of the steering wheel is wired to the left button cluster and its state is transmitted through the (light green or black) wire. Button states are transmitted by varying the resistance between the common pin of each button cluster and one of the two output pins of each button cluster. The Arduino interprets these using an analog pin using the INPUT_PULLUP pin mode with the common pins being connected to ground. The resulting resistance and output wire for any button press is listed below in hopes of saving someone else the effort required to decode these circuit boards though I ended up using analogRead values in my code so these are useless to me.</p>

<p>Taking these findings into account, I connected the yellow and red pins to ground and connected the light green, green, purple, and black wire to analog pins that were set up as INPUT_PULLUPs.

With this setup the Arduino can mostly distinguish between the buttons however some buttons produce analogRead() values that are very close to each other and are therefore mistaken by the Arduino at times. The Arduino then encodes these button presses into an 8-byte CAN packet that gets sent repeatedly over my CAN network as long as the button remains pressed. I’ve also attached the LED VCC pin to a digital pin so it can be set on by the Arduino whenever another device on the CAN network commands it to do so. The final product, inserted in the steering wheel, is depicted below.</p>
