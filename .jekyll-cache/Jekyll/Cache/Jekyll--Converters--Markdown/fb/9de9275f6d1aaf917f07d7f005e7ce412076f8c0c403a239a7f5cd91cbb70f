<p>I recently acquired a car for recreational purposes since I had saved up a decent amount of money and didn’t feel like investing it considering the state of the stock market/crypto thanks to COVID-19. I purchased a BRZ because they are built in conjunction with Toyota and this should theoretically imply that they are relatively reliable so I won’t need to worry about the mechanical aspect of the vehicle. Furthermore, this colaboration with Toyota also makes them relatively easy to work on at home which I am thankful for since I’ve had to do a wealth of maintenance on it even going as far as removing the differential with no previous mechanic experience.</p>
