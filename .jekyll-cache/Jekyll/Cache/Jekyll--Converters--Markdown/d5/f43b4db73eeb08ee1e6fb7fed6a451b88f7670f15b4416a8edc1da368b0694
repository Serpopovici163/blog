I"Ö<p>The premise of Ubisoftâ€™s Watch Dogs video game series has always fascinated me. Some of the exploits you can pull off with your in-game cell phone are far fetched but most are genuinely possible with the right amount of software work. Iâ€™ve personally always been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftopping">rooftopping</a>, moreso the aspect of getting to the roof since every building is almost like a puzzle some of which require a significant amount of critical thinking. Over time, rooftopping in my hometown became relatively dull because I knew virtually every building inside and out but with the extensive amount of buildings I have been to came a need to store critical bits of information such as which stairwell to take or what security measures are in place. Furthermore, I dove into the world of RFID hacking a couple years ago and have been collecting RFID credentials where possible to provide me with unrestricted access to these places.</p>
