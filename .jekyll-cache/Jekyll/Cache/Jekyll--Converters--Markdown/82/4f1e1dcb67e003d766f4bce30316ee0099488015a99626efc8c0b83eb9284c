<p>All cameras are wired to the center console, near the airbag module of the car, where I will mount a nVidia Jetson Orin NX. Any cameras mounted somewhere that could be reasonably reached by water have been doused in 422C conformal coating by MG Chemicals to provide an additional layer of protection from water damage.</p>

<p>TODO: add surround camera to front as well as tight/zoom IR-sensitive cameras for active night vision. Also add IR flood light up front.</p>

<h3 id="thermal-camera">Thermal Camera</h3>

<p>I decided to repurpose both of the carâ€™s fog lights since I found the fog lights themselves rather useless in practice. I did however nearly hit two deer and figured a good, practical decision might be to include a thermal camera in the front bumper. This sounds nice in practice, but making it happen for cheap was another story. I managed to obtain a handheld FLIR inspection camera for cheap due to a damaged display which was perfect for this application. I then proceeded to dissasemble it and discard of all unnecessary electronics such as its displays, buttons, wireless functionality, and visible spectrum camera/laser. Having narrowed the components down to the image sensor and the PCB required to drive it, I designed a 3D-printed bracket to mate that with the fog light mounting holes in the bumper. I initially wanted to gimbal the camera, but the complexity of doing so when compared to the advantages it provides drove me away from that idea. Instead, I mounted the sensor on a servo-driven bracket to provide pitch control which will help maintain the camera level when going up- or down-hill.</p>

<h2 id="surround-cameras">Surround Cameras</h2>

<p>Two fisheye cameras are included on the sides of the car, one in each wing mirror, to provide complete coverage of each side of the car. These cameras were mounted using a 3D-printed bracket that piggy backs off of some existing screws within the factory mirror mount and position the camera such that its optic rests flush with the factory mirror trim. In order to get the lens through the mirror trim, I used a soldering iron to cut through the plastic and then sanded the edges to get them as smoothly as possible. The passenger-side mirror came out a little rough but the drivers side looks pretty swell.</p>

<p>A similar thing was done for the rear view mirror though this time the bracket replaces a trunk release (?) button. Iâ€™m not sure if it was a trunk release button because I did not think BRZs had trunk releases but it definitely looked like a button when I took it out. Regardless, pictures of the CAD and the final product are included below alongside a snapshot of what the camera sees taken by my laptop once the install was complete. I elected to use a 210-degree camera in the back because the 136-degree cameras were not wide enough to capture the pavement and the cars behind me simoultaneously. This choice has the added benefit of allowing me to see on either side of a parking spot before backing out.</p>

<p>The camera mount consists of two parts. The first holds the camera and connects it to the trunk trim piece. It does so thanks to an extrusion that protrudes through the rectangular cutout of the trunk release button and a flange that limits how much it can protrude throught he cutout. The second part of the rear view camera mount is a rectangular extrusion that is much wider than the cutout of the trunk release and effectively acts as a clamp to secure the camera in place.</p>
