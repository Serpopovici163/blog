<p>All cameras are wired to the center console, near the airbag module of the car, where I will mount a nVidia Jetson Orin NX. Any cameras mounted somewhere that could be reasonably reached by water have been doused in 422C conformal coating by MG Chemicals to provide an additional layer of protection from water damage.</p>

<h2 id="front-sensor-package">Front Sensor Package</h2>

<p>Four cameras are included in the front bumper to complete the carâ€™s 360-degree vision system and provide both active and passive night vision to the driver.</p>

<h3 id="grill-sensor-package">Grill Sensor Package</h3>

<p>Three cameras are to be included in the carâ€™s grill. Why three? Because I can. Only one of them is truly useful to the car: a fish-eye wide angle mounted at the front-most point of the carâ€™s grill. The second camera to be included is a tighter IR-sensitive camera mounted close to the fisheye that will provide a low-latency medium-magnification feed that can be used in low light. Finally, I will likely include a gimballed low light sensor with 30x optical zoom because I have one laying around and it could be a cool feature to have. This camera may get massacred by rocks and bugs but thatâ€™s ok because it was really cheap. It does unfortunately interface through ethernet so the latency will be too great to use it when driving but it could be used by the passenger.</p>

<h3 id="thermal-camera">Thermal Camera</h3>

<p>I decided to repurpose both of the carâ€™s fog lights since I found the fog lights themselves rather useless in practice. I did however nearly hit two deer and figured a good, practical decision might be to include a thermal camera in the front bumper. This sounds nice in practice, but making it happen for cheap was another story. I managed to obtain a handheld FLIR inspection camera for cheap due to a damaged display which was perfect for this application. I then proceeded to dissasemble it and discard of all unnecessary electronics such as its displays, buttons, wireless functionality, and visible spectrum camera/laser. Having narrowed the components down to the image sensor and the PCB required to drive it, I designed a 3D-printed bracket to mate that with the fog light mounting holes in the bumper.

I initially wanted to gimbal the camera, but the complexity of doing so when compared to the advantages it provides drove me away from that idea. Instead, I mounted the sensor on a servo-driven bracket to provide pitch control which will help maintain the camera level when going up- or downhill. The bracket off to the right of the picture above is to hold the thermal cameraâ€™s PCB.</p>

<p>I have not designed the pitch controller yet though its design requirements are set: the computer will interface with my CAN network and use one IMU (mounted to the camera) to determine the angle that the camera should be at to keep itself facing along the horizon. Iâ€™m not sure if this will be practical since there are situations where one might want the camera to not be level with the theoretical horizon, but I do not see another way of doing this simply. A possible scenario where the camera shouldnâ€™t be level would be when the vehicle is traveling downhill and approaching an uphill portion and I do not see an easy way to mitigate this besides maybe using computer vision to determine what the most appropriate angle for the camera is.</p>

<p>A final consideration is protecting this camera from rock chips. I will do so by plastic-welding a mosquito net type fabric to the trim piece that goes in front of the thermal camera; this should hopefully prevent any rock chips from damaging the optic.</p>

<h3 id="ir-flood-light">IR Flood Light</h3>

<p>The remaining fog light will be used for a high power IR flood light to provide me with active nightvision and compliment the passive nightvision provided by the thermal camera. I have not chosen a light for this purpose yet or designed any form of mounting hardware for it. Should be light work, I think.</p>

<h2 id="surround-cameras">Surround Cameras</h2>

<p>Two fisheye cameras are included on the sides of the car, one in each wing mirror, to provide complete coverage of each side of the car. I initially wanted to remake the entire mirror trim such that it could have dedicated mounting points for a camera. I began by 3D-scanning the existing trim pieces but quickly ran into a myriad of road blocks seeing as working with 3D-scan data is a rather painful process. Solidworks would only let me insert 20000 (?) polygons in a 3D model which was far too few to truly represent the finish of the mirrorâ€™s trim and so I swiftly scrapped this approach.</p>

<p>In the end, these cameras were mounted using a 3D-printed bracket that piggy backs off of some existing screws within the factory mirror mount and position the camera such that its optic rests flush with the factory mirror trim. I lined up the image sensors through eye-balling and trial and error. I got an idea of how far down the optic should be and how far out it should be from the existing screws in the mirror mount and worked backwards from there. In order to get the lens through the mirror trim, I used a soldering iron to cut through the plastic and then sanded the edges to get them as smoothly as possible. The passenger-side mirror came out a little rough but the drivers side looks pretty swell.</p>

<p>A similar thing was done for the rear view mirror though this time the bracket replaces a trunk release (?) button. Iâ€™m not sure if it was a trunk release button because I did not think BRZs had trunk releases but it definitely looked like a button when I took it out. Regardless, pictures of the CAD and the final product are included below alongside a snapshot of what the camera sees taken by my laptop once the install was complete. I elected to use a 210-degree camera in the back because the 136-degree cameras were not wide enough to capture the pavement and the cars behind me simoultaneously. This choice has the added benefit of allowing me to see on either side of a parking spot before backing out.</p>

<p>The camera mount consists of two parts. The first holds the camera and connects it to the trunk trim piece. It does so thanks to an extrusion that protrudes through the rectangular cutout of the trunk release button and a flange that limits how much it can protrude throught he cutout. The second part of the rear view camera mount is a rectangular extrusion that is much wider than the cutout of the trunk release and effectively acts as a clamp to secure the camera in place.</p>
