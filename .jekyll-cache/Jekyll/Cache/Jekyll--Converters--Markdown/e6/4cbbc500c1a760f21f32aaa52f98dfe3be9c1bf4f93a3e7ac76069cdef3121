I"’<p>Annota is my first ever attempt at developing software for Android devices. As part of a second year course, we were challenged to develop an application that could digitize a userâ€™s notes in order to categorize and index them. This application is far from exemplar for a variety of reasons however I had a tremendous level of success considering I knew very little about Java and Android development prior to this project. This was a group project so the work was done in conjunction with three other students though I got away with doing the coding work while the others focused on testing the application and taking care of written deliverables.</p>
