<h2 id="network">Network</h2>

<p>The car has an ethernet-based network to connect its various computers and an ethernet-based camera up front. This network also provides WiFi to passengers and internet access to the aforementioned devices. The WiFi-LTE <em>link</em> modem I purchased only has 4 ports available but I need 5 to connect the three computers, camera up front, and a diangostic port included in the dash for debugging purposes. The slot below the ethernet jack was meant to be a USB-C port for tethering my phone and running Android Auto but I have not installed the port in the car just yet.</p>
