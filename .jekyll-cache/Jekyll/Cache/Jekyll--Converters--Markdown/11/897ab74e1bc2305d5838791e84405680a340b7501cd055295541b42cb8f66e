I"Q<h3 id="lighting-modifications">Lighting Modifications</h3>

<p>Some modifications require extensive control of the vehicle’s lights however I am not willing to alter anything about the car’s computers so my solution consists of placing relays along the wiring harnesses controlling the vehicle’s lights with two separate computers on each end of the car. Each computer has a combination of mechanical and solid state relays depending on how frequently a light is expected to toggle on/off. Mechanical relays are used for lights that rarely toggle and because they provide a normally closed and normally open set of contacts. This is important because the lighting computers receive constant power regardless of the vehicle’s state and therefore power draw must be minimized when the vehicle is not running.</p>

It uses four solid state relays (top left) to drive the brake lights and turn signals of the car by connecting them to the car’s battery. The third and fourth brake light of the car (third is in the windshield and fourth is F1 style in bumper) are converted to addressable LEDs and do not require relays. Addressable LEDs have also been integrated into the reverse lights (two lights adjoined to the fourth brake light) and the two rear quarter panel windows of the car. Excluding the solid state relays, the computer contains two mechanical relays (bottom left) for running lights, a CANBUS module (bottom right), an Arduino (top right), and a 5V regulator on the backside. Currently, this computer turns lights on based on whether or not live data is being sent across the CANBUS since it is always powered and I have not yet figured out what value represents the stte of the vehicle’s running lights. This is not ideal since a side effect of my current solution is that running lights turn on when doors open or the car is unlocked etc.</p>
