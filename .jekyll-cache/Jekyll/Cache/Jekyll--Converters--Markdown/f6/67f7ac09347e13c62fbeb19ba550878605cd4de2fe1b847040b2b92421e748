I"š<p>This page briefly summarized the extensive amount of work that went into designing the avionics system for the University of Ottawaâ€™s rocketry team. We unfortunately had to scrap last yearâ€™s work since it was very unorganized and we had absolutely no documentation to work off of. For this project, I was given the requirement that the system be modular, incrimentally upgradeable, and above all well documented. Fortunately, I am a fan of documentation and have included the two primary documents that describe the system below. This blog post will gloss over the design of these boards, however in-depth information is available in the documents below.</p>
