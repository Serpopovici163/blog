I"$<p>This page briefly summarizes the extensive amount of work that went into designing the avionics system for the University of Ottawa’s rocketry team. We unfortunately had to scrap last year’s work since it was very unorganized and we had absolutely no documentation to work off of. For this project, I was given the requirement that the system be modular, incrimentally upgradeable, and above all well documented. Fortunately, I am a fan of documentation and have included the two primary documents that describe the system below. This blog post will gloss over the design of these boards, however in-depth information is available in the documents below. I would also like to add that this was my first project involving PCB design, hence the very poor design of the V1 boards depicted below.</p>
