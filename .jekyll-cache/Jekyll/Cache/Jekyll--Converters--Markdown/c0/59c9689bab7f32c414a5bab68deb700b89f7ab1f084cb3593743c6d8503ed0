<p>The retrofit brackets for this vehicle were designed by first measuring and modelling the mount points to the vehicle before extruding a general shape to house all the required components. The components are then arranged on the aforementioned general shape such that their screw holes/mount points can be cut after which the bulk of the material is removed leaving a barebones structure which can be further broken down into smaller pieces to facilitate manufacturing.</p>

<p>The head unit bracket is a perfect example of this technique. The design was built symmetrically, and as such, I began by modelling the left side before mirroring it to generate the entire assembly. I knew I would need two â€˜platformsâ€™ to house all the required components so I began by measuring the mount hole positions from the old head unit and generating two basic mount â€˜earsâ€™ before extruding an arbitrary platform attached to each ear. The platforms were extended an arbitrary amount in both directions based on how much space I estimated to be available inside the vehicleâ€™s cavity and how far the head unit display would be mounted. The head unit bracket holds the following hardware as can be seen in the <em>PIC</em> to the right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Head unit display</li>
  <li>Head unit display driver</li>
  <li>Khadas VIM4</li>
  <li>Voltage regulator</li>
  <li>Driver-facing camera</li>
</ol>

<p>No amp needed up front since itâ€™s in the trunk from factory. That being said it only drives the front speakers and I canâ€™t figure out how the rear side speakers are powered so there may be more amplifiers throughout the vehicle. I also need to include an amplifier for a loudspeaker up front which may end up in the head unit if there is space.</p>
