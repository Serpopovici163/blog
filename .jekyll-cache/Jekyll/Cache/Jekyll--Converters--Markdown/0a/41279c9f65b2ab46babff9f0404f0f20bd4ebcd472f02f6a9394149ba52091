<p>I managed to rear end someone in this car, definitely my fault, but I was not willing to let it die that soon because I had barely done any work on it. The accident luckily wasn’t very bad, the other car suffered next to no damage and mine took most of the hit. I wasn’t going awfully fast when I hit the other car so my front end did not crumple much and the car was therefore perfectly fine, mechanically speaking that is. Here are pictures of the repair process :)</p>

<p>Here are some pictures immediately following the accident showing the extent of the damage. I bent a variety of things up front but the frame rails of the car remained straight. These pictures show the bent front crash bar, bent rad support, bent fender, and bent hood.</p>
