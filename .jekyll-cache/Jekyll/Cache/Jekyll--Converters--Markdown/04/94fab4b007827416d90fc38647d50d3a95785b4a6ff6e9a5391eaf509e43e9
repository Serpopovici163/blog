<p>Control of a vehicleâ€™s external lighting is safety critical, so Iâ€™ve settled on designing a fully-redundant custom circuit board with 12 MOSFET-driven channels to handle â€˜dumbâ€™ lights and 8 addressable channels to handle a set of addressable LED arrays retrofitted throughout the vehicle.</p>

<p>The primary challenge with designing a redundant board for this application is the required use of P-channel MOSFETs and the limited analog I/O available on the Arduino Mega I am using for control. P-channel MOSFETs are required since the carâ€™s chassis is a system-wide ground that all components always have access to and we must therefore toggle the high side of a circuit to turn it on and off. This is an issue because P-channel MOSFETs need their gates to be driven low in order to turn on but the MOSFET would operate off of the car battery whereas the driving circuit would be operating at a much lower logic-level voltage. Therefore, an intermediary N-channel MOSFET must be used to drive the P-channel from a logic-level signal.</p>

<p>This board has gone through many design iterations with the first being as described <a href="https://circuitjournal.com/how-to-use-a-p-channel-mosfet-with-an-arduino">here</a>. I initially wanted to solely use P-channel MOSFETs to decrease the number of components but this seemed like a bad idea so, in the end, I decided to settle for a more traditional design. The final design includes the intermediary N-channel MOSFETs to drive the P-channels and is described more in depth below.</p>

<p>Two MOSFETs (bottom right) are included in parallel, both of which are immediately followed by a Schottky diode to prevent backflow from the other MOSFET. This is necessary because a diagnostic pin is included prior to the Schottky and senses voltage which would be biased by backflow from the other MOSFET therefore hindering the detection of a MOSFET failure. The diagnostic connections use two sets of voltage dividers and voltage followers (top left) to reduce Q1â€™s voltage to 1V and Q2â€™s voltage to 3V. The outputs of the voltage followers are funneled into a summing amplifier such that the final signal ranges between 0 and 4V. Finally, a differential amplifier (top right) is included for measuring current across the shunt.</p>

<p>MOSFETS SCHEMATIC</p>

<p>For control, two Arduino Mega EMBEDs are inclded. These were chosen because I have about a dozen on hand right now and they have been reliable in my experience. Regardless, two Arduinos with separate CAN transceivers are included on the board as depicted in the schematic below:</p>

<p>OVERALL SCHEMATIC</p>

<p>At any given moment, one of the Arduinos is considered the â€˜masterâ€™. The master is in charge of outputting signals to the MOSFET and addressable channels while simoultaneously communicating its state over to the slave Arduino over a UART connection. The master updates the slave at regular intervals such that the updates themselves function as â€˜heartbeatâ€™ signals assuring the slave that the master is operating optimally. Should the master miss a heartbeat for whatever reason, the slave sends a hardware reset pin to the current master after which it assumes the master role and resumes signal outputs based on the last state update it received over UART. This system also allows the Arduinos to swap roles ever 30 days since my asynchronous code uses the millis() function to keep track of time and its value will exceed the maximum possible variable size in approximately 50 days.</p>

<h3 id="lighting-modifications">Lighting Modifications</h3>

<p>Some modifications require extensive control of the vehicleâ€™s lights however I am not willing to alter anything about the carâ€™s computers so my solution consists of placing relays along the wiring harnesses controlling the vehicleâ€™s lights with two separate computers on each end of the car. Each computer has a combination of mechanical and solid state relays depending on how frequently a light is expected to toggle on/off. Mechanical relays are used for lights that rarely toggle and because they provide a normally closed and normally open set of contacts. This is important because the lighting computers receive constant power regardless of the vehicleâ€™s state and therefore power draw must be minimized when the vehicle is not running.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/brz/rear_light_manager.jpg" alt="Rear light manager computer" style="float: right; width:50%; height:80%; margin-left: 10px;" /> The rear lighting computer is pictured to the right and I expect the front computer to be highly similar. It uses four solid state relays (top left) to drive the brake lights and turn signals of the car by connecting them to the carâ€™s battery. The third and fourth brake light of the car (third is in the windshield and fourth is F1 style in bumper) are converted to addressable LEDs and do not require relays. Addressable LEDs have also been integrated into the reverse lights (two lights adjoined to the fourth brake light) and the two rear quarter panel windows of the car. Excluding the solid state relays, the computer contains two mechanical relays (bottom left) for running lights, a CANBUS module (bottom right), an Arduino (top right), and a 5V regulator on the backside. Currently, this computer turns lights on based on whether or not live data is being sent across the CANBUS since it is always powered and I have not yet figured out what value represents the stte of the vehicleâ€™s running lights. This is not ideal since a side effect of my current solution is that running lights turn on when doors open or the car is unlocked etc.</p>
