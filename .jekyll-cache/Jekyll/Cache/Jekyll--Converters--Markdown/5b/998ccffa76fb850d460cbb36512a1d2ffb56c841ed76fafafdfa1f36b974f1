I"!<p>I recently acquired a car for recreational purposes since I had saved up a decent amount of money and didn’t feel like investing it. I purchased a BRZ because they are built in conjunction with Toyota and this should theoretically imply that they are relatively reliable and I won’t need to worry about the mechanical aspects of the vehicle. Furthermore, the BRZ’s interior is driver-centered while maintaining a relatively simple geometry that should facilitate the design of custom dash components to fit my upgraded electronics.</p>
