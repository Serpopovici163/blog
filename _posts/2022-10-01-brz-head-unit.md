### CAD

The retrofit brackets for this vehicle were designed by first measuring and modelling the mount points to the vehicle before extruding a general shape to house all the required components. The components are then arranged on the aforementioned general shape such that their screw holes/mount points can be cut after which the bulk of the material is removed leaving a barebones structure which can be further broken down into smaller pieces to facilitate manufacturing.

The head unit bracket is a perfect example of this technique. The design was built symmetrically, and as such, I began by modelling the left side before mirroring it to generate the entire assembly. I knew I would need two 'platforms' to house all the required components so I began by measuring the mount hole positions from the old head unit and generating two basic mount 'ears' before extruding an arbitrary platform attached to each ear. The platforms were extended an arbitrary amount in both directions based on how much space I estimated to be available inside the vehicle's cavity and how far the head unit display would be mounted. The head unit bracket holds the following hardware as can be seen in the *PIC* to the right:

1. Head unit display
2. Head unit display driver
3. Khadas VIM4
4. Voltage regulator
6. Driver-facing camera

No amp needed up front since it's in the trunk from factory. That being said it only drives the front speakers and I can't figure out how the rear side speakers are powered so there may be more amplifiers throughout the vehicle. I also need to include an amplifier for a loudspeaker up front which may end up in the head unit if there is space.
