Annota is my first ever attempt at developing software for Android devices. As part of a second year course, we were challenged to develop an application that could digitize a user's notes in order to categorize and index them. This application is far from exemplar for a variety of reasons however I had a tremendous level of success considering I knew very little about Java and Android development prior to this project. This was a group project so the work was done in conjunction with three other students though I got away with doing the coding work while the others focused on testing the application and taking care of written deliverables.

# Client's Needs

The client for this product suffers from Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an auto-immune disase impacting the central nervous, which causes her to suffer from short-term memory loss and fatigue. Since there is no known cure for MS as of this writing, available treatments focus on mitigating the impact of symptoms in patients. For our client, this entails developing an application which can digitize and index important information and provide them with time-based and potentially location-based reminders. Based on a couple interviews, the following needs were identified for the project:

| Customer Need | Design Criteria | Importance |
|----------|----------|----------|
| A product for everybody | Must be accessible and usable by everyone. | 1 |
| Ideally a virtual 'cork board' | Must be able to capture and organize text and images with possible support for other medias such as video | 2 |
| Needs notifications | Should have reminder function | 3 |
| Red and green need to be avoided | Accessibilty-focused UI | 4 |
| Automate organization | Enable easy transfer of handwritten text to digital form | 5 |
| English as primary language | Multiple language option with English as primary | 6 |
| Compatible with many devices | Should support multiple platforms | 7 |
| Copy annotations from textbook | Read, annotate, and categorize selective parts of written content | 8 |
| Zoom in and out of documents | Integrate an image viewer interface | 9 |
| Make it aesthetic | Visual appeal and stimulate user | 10 |
