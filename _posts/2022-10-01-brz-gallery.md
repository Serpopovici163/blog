## Accident

![Accident](/assets/img/brz/accident.jpg){: style="float: right; width:50%; height:80%;"}

I managed to rear end someone in this car, definitely my fault, but I was not willing to let it die that soon because I had barely done any work on it. The accident luckily wasn't very bad, the other car suffered next to no damage and mine took most of the hit. I wasn't going awfully fast when I hit the other car so my front end did not crumple much and the car was therefore perfectly fine, mechanically speaking that is. Here are pictures of the repair process :)

Here are some pictures immediately following the accident showing the extent of the damage. I bent a variety of things up front but the frame rails of the car remained straight. These pictures show the bent front crash bar, bent rad support, bent fender, and bent hood. This happened in the fall when I didn't have much capital to throw around so I solely replaced the front crash bar and rad support which allowed the hood to close again. Due to the way the car was bent, the hood would not close again once I finally got it open.

Even with the rad support replaced, the hood did not line up appropriately with the front bumper which makes sense. As it turns out, the passenger side fender support bracket was bent in addition to the fender itself, both of which dictate how the bumper and headlight mount. The hood was definitely bent itself and the hood hinges were also bent which further influenced the panel gaps on the car.

The pictures above were from replacing the fender support bracket one spring time came around. This definitely improved panel gaps however they most definitely weren't fixed due to the hood still being bent. Furthermore, the passenger side fender had rusted while the car was in storage for the winter so I ended up purchasing a new fender and having it paint-matched professionally.

These were the final steps of the repair. I sent my airbag module to the states and also went there to pick up a new bumper alongside all the accompanying trim pieces. I got a black hood from Toronto and then sent the car in for paint to have the whole front end redone :)

And just like that, she's back!
